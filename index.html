            <h1>NGO Event</h1>
            <p>Welcome to NGO Event, where NGOs come together to create meaningful change.</p>
            <h2>What is an NGO?</h2>
            <p>An NGO (Non-Governmental Organization) is a non-profit organization that operates independently of any government. NGOs are typically formed to address social, environmental, or humanitarian issues.</p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At NGO Event, our mission is to empower NGOs to create meaningful change in their communities and beyond. We provide a platform for NGOs to connect, collaborate, and organize events that drive positive impact.</p>
            <h2>How You Can Get Involved</h2>
            <p>Whether you're an NGO looking to host an event or an individual interested in supporting NGO causes, there are many ways to get involved. Sign up to create or participate in events, volunteer your time, or donate to support NGO initiatives.</p>
